Your monthly charge for your Memorizor subscription failed.
Don't worry, you probably just need to update your credit card information, which can be done on our website.
If you don't fix this soon, you will loose all of the benefits of being a paid memorizor customer.
As always, if you need any help or are confused about this email, please reply and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
